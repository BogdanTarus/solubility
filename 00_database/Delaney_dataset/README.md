The aqueous solubility reference research of [John S. Delaney](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci034243x)
 is often used for comparison by works trying to predict the solubility based on the chemical structure. Also, I was inspired by the works of [Pat Walters](http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2018/09/predicting-aqueous-solubility-its.html) and [Chanin Nantasenamat](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-machine-learning-for-drug-discovery-1ccb5fdf81ad). The Delaneyâ€™s data set was downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney.csv).
