# Prediction of aqueous solubility of novel drug-like compounds

## Overview

## Prepare the working environment

## Dataset preparation

## Decide on the machine learning model

## Learn the model

## Test the model

## Predict the aqueous solubility of novel compounds w/o experimental solubility values

## Construct a web application

This application will be a flask deployed on the cloud that will take as input the SMILES string as molecular structure fingerprint of the compound and will display the solubility in units of logarithm of mol/l.
