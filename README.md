# Prediction of aqueous solubility of novel drug-like compounds

## Overview

## Prepare the working environment

## Dataset preparation

### Individual compounds and datasets with experimental solubility values

from literature
from dedicated data bases

### Build the molecular fingerprint as SMILES

The resulting data set will have the duplicates removed and the solubility values unified using units of mol/l at room temperature and neutral pH.

## Decide on the deep learning model

## Learn and test the model

## Predict the aqueous solubility of novel compounds w/o experimental solubility values

## Construct a web application

This application will be a flask deployed on the cloud that will take as input the SMILES of the new compound and  will display the solubility.
